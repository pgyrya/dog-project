# dog-project
This is my work fulfilling practice project built by Udacity team, designed to practice deep learning algorithm for computer vision with elements of Transfer learning, re-using popular network architectures (e.g. Xception)

Please refer to report.html for HTML version (you would need to download it on your computer to view as it's slightly over 5 MB). 
Full credit goes to Udacity nanodegree program for designing most of the code base, I take credit for getting familiar with the setup and practicing developing the project to logical point envisioned by Udacity project.
